## Why Design an Experiment

It cost money to run experiment, train algorithms and implement algorithms.
<br>
We saw this in March's meetup where initially one needed to upgrade to Pro Colab.
But then we saw that we could reduce sample size and runtime. 
Which might have allowed us to scrapped by with the free version of Colab. 

<br>
There are mathematical models you can use to identify what is the number of sample you need to get good results.

<br>
In addition, not knowing how to adjust your experiment to meet the risk, can **cost you your job** and or the company a lot of money.

<br>
Recently, Google debuted their version of ChatGPT. This was a high risk demo. It also failed and cost the company $100B in valuation. 

<br>
You need to know how to adjust your experiments for the risk.

This is where design experimentation comes in. How does one adjust for risk while reducing the cost of running the experiment.

<br>

One way to reduce cost and risk is to set-up an A/B Test.

---

## What is A/B Testing

<br>


A/B testing is a **randomized** controlled experiment done in production.

<br>
There are two tests: A and B, in which a single variable adjusted (B Test).
<br>
<br>
This variation, **might** affect a user's behavior.
<br>

![](./img/ab.svg)

<br>

#### Goal: Increase End User's Objective

* **Business:** Income increases >> Costs of change
* **Health Care:**  Health increases >> Side effect

:::{.notes}

* Not explicitly telling users they are in a test
* "User" is loosely used.  It could be servers, Say testing speed: Google vs AWS cloud
:::

---

#### So why do A/B Testing

::: {.incremental}
- Why spend the resources to do tests
- Why risk angering your customers with changes?
- I got data miners, I do not need tests!  
- I am a ML Scientist, I don't need to know the business side

:::

### Life is complicated. 

Domain knowledge only gets you so far!

<br>

Subject-matter experts (SME) from Microsoft, Netflixs etc, find when they implement changes 
that only a small fraction of their ideas have the planned outcome [@sweet].

<br>

Even though we are isolating a single variable, 
that variable interacts with a million other variables.
<br>
You simply can not model everything or know everything.

  - Even tested changes
    - Though less likely!

### Trader Janes has a New Pizza
Say there is a grocer called Trader Janes and it wants to add a new pizza to its line up.
<br>
However, they need to keep the same number of types it sells a constant.
Freezer only holds N pizzas.

<br>
They will have to remove one pizza from their lineup to add the new item.
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Typical Work flow

- Marketing asks a _Data Miner_ to rank popularity of pizza.
- The Data Miner finds the pizza that sells the least.
- Stores remove that pizza.
- Stores add new pizza.

### What happened?

::: {.incremental}

- Don't know, because the store implemented many changes that week!
- It's the week after Thanksgiving and sales always go down that week.
- Turns out there was a small group of heavy spenders that love this pizza.

#### A / B Testing help predict what changes will increase the bottom line.

## A / B Testing Limitations { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }


A/B Testing is used to clarify a vision, but does not create vision.

<br>

For example, an ophthalmologist quickly gives you a set of two choices; 
1 or 2 (2 or 3) that lead to sharpen vision.  Their test, like A/B, can not give you vision.

<br>

##### Though without a clarity,  a vision has serious limitation.

<br>


A/B Testing is an extension of DevOps.  
Feedback will be the results of the A/B Testing.

## A/B Tests 
### The good, the bad and the ugly

:::: {.columns }
::: {.column width=10% }
:::
::: {.column width=70% }


#### Rewards

- Increase companies goals: (make more successful):
  - Business: Profits
  - Healthcare: Health
  - Defence: Situational Awareness
  
:::
::::

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

#### Risks

- Test cost time and money
- Don't know what percent of risk is acceptable
  - Medical and Defence will have higher threshold of risk
- Upset customers
- Change can make things worse


:::
:::{.column}


#### Mitigation 

- Have the smallest test possible
- 5% False Positive 
- 20% False Negative
  - Typical of non life critical changes
- Minimize number of samples

:::
::::


---



## Reducing Costs 
### Minimal Viable Product

Need to create the smallest, fastest A/B Test that is statistically meaningful.

<br>
<br> 

### How do you minimize the number of samples (N)?

<br>

Want an N samples that show a 5% false positive and 20% false negative.

<br>

$$
N = ?
$$

---

## 
### Use Statistics 

<br>

Defines minimum number of samples (**N**) as:

$$
N > 2.48 \left( \frac{\sigma_\Delta}{\Delta} \right)^2
$$

<hr>

- $\Delta$: How much of a difference is needed to make the change
  - It cost money to make a change
  - Increase to bottom line needs to be significant, to accept risk
    -  _Example_: Trader Jane's Pizza needs sales to increase by 3%
- $\sigma_\Delta$: estimated by business historical data
  - $\sigma_\Delta$ = $~\sqrt{2 \sigma_{log}^2}$
    - $\sigma_{log}$: How much does sales fluctuate over a given time period.

---


### Important

<br>

- #### Unless there is a clear, measurable advantage, no change should occur.

<br>

- #### There is no guarantee that change will be effective.
    
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

#### Bias and Harm

In addition, our testing and product should do **no** harm.

<br>

More on this later

---

<br><br><br>

### Where does 2.48 comes from?

<br>
<br>


$$
N > 2.48 \left( \frac{\sigma_\Delta}{\Delta} \right)^2
$$

---

## Rules of Thumb: 20 / 5 Rule 

<br>

#### Assume there is no difference between A and B

$$
\Delta = 0 \\
 \Delta = B - A 
$$

<br>
<hr>
::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

**False positive** 

- A is better but, you implemented B
- incurs an explicit cost

:::
:::{.column}

**False negative** 

- B is better but, you stuck with A
- incurs an implicit cost


:::
::::
<hr>

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

| $\alpha$ == **False Positive rate** 

* 5% => $z_{score}$ = -1.64

<br>

| You can assume B is better than A

:::
:::{.column}

| $\beta$== **False Negative rate** 

* 20% => $z_{score}$ = 0.84

<br>

| You can assume A is better than B

:::
::::

---


#### From Standard Normal Distribution

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=32%}


**Mean** is 0

<br>

**Standard deviation**: $\sigma$


<br>

$z_{score}$ measures the distance between a 
 point and the mean in units of $\sigma$

----
<br>

| $Z_{score}$ = -1.64 (**5%**)

| $Z_{score}$ = 0.84 (**20%**)

<br>

$$
1.64 + 0.84 = 2.48
$$

## { background-image='img/bluebox.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Yeah,

we have our minimal viable test.

<br>


But we are not done yet.  

<br>

One more thing to worry about

<br>


### Can this (change/test) harm our customers?

---

## Do no Harm: F potential { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

If we implement B, how F--ed up will that make the users?

<br>

If we tested B, how F--ed up will that make the users?

---

### Social Sites
A/B Testing is being done on users without consent, knowledge and at scale (100K of users).

<br>

Group mindset has been around since the 1950's.
Current research shows that our minds physically change when we work together [@change-minds] socially.

So it is scary to read 

* Facebook: Tested their algorithm to see if it really does radicalize people [@facebook-radical]
* LinkedIn: Tested on 20 million users to find out how links affect people's career/jobs [@linkedin-jobs]
* Facebook: Tested on 700,000 users to see if they can make them sad [@facebook-sad]

### Health Care

* Drug Companies: OxyContin [@oxycontin]
  * 1% addiction rate advertised (From non real world users)
  * 10-30% addiction rate in real life

---


### Remedy

#### Good news

There are already strong standard for testing on human subjects.  
There is the IRB (Internal review board) preprocess.

<br>

It has required and continuous training and certification: CiTI training.

<br>


#### Bad news

Only required for companies receiving federal government funding: Universities, Air Force, Army etc.

<br>

Not required for companies that work with schools (state and local funding) and social media companies.

<br>

### F potential

In light of this, I propose researchers use the F potential.

<br>

(Currently, not a real thing.  Just something to think about.)

---

### $F_{upped}$  Potential

$$
F_{upped} =  \begin{cases}
       \text{1,} &\quad\text{if seriously harmed}\\
       \text{0.5,} &\quad\text{if slightly harmed} \\
       \text{0,} &\quad\text{if not measurable}\\
       \text{-0.5,} &\quad\text{becomes better} \\
       \text{-1,} &\quad\text{becomes a lot better} \\
     \end{cases}
$$

If $F_{upped}$ > 0, test should be a no-go.

If $F_{upped}$ < 0, $\Delta$ should be halved. 

* e.g. $\Delta$ is the amount of gain the company needs to make the change.

<br>

_Example_: Trader Jane's Pizza needs sales to increase by 3% ($\Delta$). <br>
If pizza made people better, then $\Delta=1.5\%$.

---



## One more thing to worry about 

## Seen and Unseen Bias { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

Biases can increase the F-potential. 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

Luckily, A/B Testing can help with both unseen and seen bias.



---

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Example: Unseen Bias

I know of three small business that where started by **young** women 
in the Dayton area. 

<br>

Their original logo design used beautifully detailed font.

<br>

Unfortunately, this detailed font would make it difficult for people like me (over 40) to read it.

<br>
<hr>

They literally could see their logo.

<br>

#### However

Their logo was not readable to me when I drove by!

<br>
<hr>
<br>


#### This is an unseen bias.

These women (All of whom where lovely and kind) 
did not know that they made a 
logo could not be read by me.

### Contrast threshold function (CTF) of the Eye

The human eye's ability to resolve a spatial frequency is dependent on contrast.
This contrast threshold function will change with age.

- At ~40 your eye will need more contrast to *see*.

- Old Logo: High frequency information 
  - thin lines
- New Logo: Medium frequency:
  - medium width lines

### Change Risks

- Attract more old people, alienate young
- Loyal customers might not like change

## Voice Bias in 21st century? { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

With more diverse workforce, a research(er) bias  will go down.  

- **True**

<br>
<hr>
<br>

##### But, there is still unseen bias in voice in the 21st century!

<br>

Google and Apple had a hard time getting voice recognition 
to work for kids [@kids_voice]

<br>

Not only do kids speak at higher frequencies than women, they have different speaking patterns.

<br>

One can not simply take an adult's voice and shift the frequency.
So ML/AI have a hard time figuring what kids are saying.

<br>

### Why kids are important

The market for voice recognition for kids looks to have a strong market growth.

## Conclusion { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }


A/B testing is a **randomized** controlled experiment done **in production**.

<br>
There are two tests: A and B, in which a single variable adjusted (B Test).
<br>

This variation, **might** affect a user's behavior.
 

<hr>
<br>

### Your A/B Testing should:

* Make the company more successful.
* Follow some ethical guidelines, like the **$F_{upped}$** potential
   - If $F_{upped}$ > 0, test should be a no-go.
   - If $F_{upped}$ < 0, $\Delta$ should be halved. 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### A/B Testing has Risk

No free lunch.  
Even after testing, test results might not make the company more successful.
