    "text": "Why Design an Experiment\nIt cost money to run experiment, train algorithms and implement algorithms.  We saw this in March’s meetup where initially one needed to upgrade to Pro Colab. But then we saw that we could reduce sample size and runtime. Which might have allowed us to scrapped by with the free version of Colab.\n There are mathematical models you can use to identify what is the number of sample you need to get good results.\n In addition, not knowing how to adjust your experiment to meet the risk, can cost you your job and or the company a lot of money.\n Recently, Google debuted their version of ChatGPT. This was a high risk demo. It also failed and cost the company $100B in valuation.\n You need to know how to adjust your experiments for the risk.\nThis is where design experimentation comes in. How does one adjust for risk while reducing the cost of running the experiment.\n\nOne way to reduce cost and risk is to set-up an A/B Test."
